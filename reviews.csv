"After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.PROS:- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ₹1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.",Aditya Sharma,Verified Purchase,2023-05-07,3813
"I'll keep it short and direct.-Great in hand feel. The aluminium frame and glass back feel nice to hold.- Probably the best screen. QHD, Really bright, and high refresh rate.-Amazing battery life. I charge my phone to 85% and with a screen on time of about 6-7 hours get home with more than 40% left.-Great cameras. Not even gonna get deep into it.-The Spen is wonderful to use. Really helped improve my productivity.-One ui is probably my favourite Android skin and with Android 14 it's even better.-Samsung will provide updates for this phone for 5 years. That coupled with the fact that Samsung offers the cheapest repair options in India mean you don't really need to worry about getting a new one for the next 5 years.-And yes it takes calls and no network issues.The only thing this phone doesn't do is make coffee .If it is in your budget, you would not get a better phone than this. That is until the next one comes out.",Prasada reddy padala,Verified Purchase,2023-07-03,928

"First of all, this was my last smartphone purchase from Amazon as they are complete frauds. I was denied a replacement and return pick up was fraudulently cancelled multiple times over a period of 3 months. Avoid buying smartphones from online portals because the authenticity and customer support will always be doubtful. Coming to the phone, It’s a very good phone with excellent battery life and very little overheating issues that plagued the S22 ultra. However, the bane of buying a phone from Samsung is the over-processing and over-sharpening of images from the default camera. This continues to be an issue after several years and updates. One of the reasons why I can’t bring myself to recommend this phone to someone who is looking to take realistic and naturally detailed photos.",Sukoon Sharma,Verified Purchase,2024-01-20,790
"I was samsung follower sing samsung galaxy series,  bit last time purchased google pixel 7pro 256gb. And found that it was good phone but no call recorder,  and it's camera was best then I compared my pixel with S23ultra and found there was not that much difference yes pixel camera was a bit good but I am not that professional or like that but found that apart from camera everything else is best in samsung s23ultra ..Also there was in built "" Call recorder "" which I always needed and that was main point where pixel was lagging behind .... and also found samsung galaxy s23ultra way more fast and efficient than pixel also there was no heating issue like pixel in this samsung galaxy s23 ultra....also I was never apple fan and never found it worth compared samsung, used apple 14 ,apart from camera where there may be difference of 0.5% between samsung and apple camera apple is over hyped and not a value for money phone and also you can't run multiple apps in background in apple and no call recorder also there is no back button or symbol in apple it's random some times you swipe it sometime some app has cross symbol in any corner that you have to search....better go for samsung it's always value for money. This review is not paid I have used all three master phones apple 14 pro, pixel and now samsung s23ultra....found S23 ultra to be the winner.",Dnyaneshwar Chavan,Verified Purchase,2024-01-29,1361
"This phone is very good allrounder with very beautiful display to watch Netflix YouTube etc, good battery backup and best phone camera ever with premium build quality by Samsung.Im generally an apple lover and I'm using apple only phones since iphone 6s upto my current iPhone 13 pro as my primary phone and I earlier I used to purchase Android phones  as my back up phones like one plus 9,Vivo x80 pro but none of themamazed me with their outstanding performance like samsung. Its a costly phone but well worth it and infact I will not buy any iphone again anytime soon and this phone will definitely replace my current iPhone as my primary phone.",Dnyaneshwar Chavan,Verified Purchase,2023-11-07,648
"I ordered this on 1-Jul Sat day and got it delivered in few hours time. Delivery was super fast. However , the phone is having issues - the call volume sound is too low, I can barely hear other side talking in home..in traffic it's almost impossible. The charging port has issue, if we move the wire slightly during charging, it will stop charging. In the car also, android auto disconnects with slightest bump. Raised a request for product replacement,  they assigned technical inspection. IIt was supposed to be done at home physically, however the technician called on phone, asked to I stall a inspection software ND said he will provide the report to Amazon. I received notification from Amazon and the call the customer service today only to know that the technician marked the issue as resolved. I was very surprised to know this. I logged a complaint with Amazon customer care, they now asked to wait for 48 hours and they will call back, so waiting..will update in this review once I hear back, hoping it will resolved properly.All in all, not a good experience so far with this purchase, one lesson learnt is not to buy high-end phones in Amazon anymore, it's very agonizing..yesterday I visited a nearby Samsung cafe and the gentleman also said not to buy high-end phones online. FYI..",Jitender Sharma,Verified Purchase,2023-05-07,1296

"Never been an apple fan. So in the android world this is the best, no doubts. Comparing the camera quality of Samsung s23 ultra and iPhone 14 pro max, s23 ultra is way better.

The pictures are crisp. They don't look less than any dslr camera. In love with the look of this phone. Steel coated side bezels are stunning. I wasn't confident about choosing this color but now I'm in love with it too. Photos in telephoto mode are a little grainy. Normal mode is way more better. Phone heats up after 20 minutes of nonstop use. Battery life lasts for a day so its ok ok. No other problem so far. Setting up this phone was so easy. Touch test went smooth like butter. Thanks a lot amazon for the coupon and card offers. ❤️😇,Bose,Verified Purchase,2023-10-25,541

"I got this phone just before making an international Trip. The phone served me really well. It's been super smooth and I've received a lot of compliments for my photos (Hey maybe that's also some part due to my skill, yes?).But the phone has a great battery life, quite often I'd come back home with around 50% battery (with BT and Loc on).  Mostly not with Power Saver on, but I did keep it on on some days initially.I hardly use the S-pen, mostly due to no habit, but it seems a cool addition for those with smaller hands. For me, I have giant Hands, so i can easily use the entire phone with my two hands.I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a premium product. The specifications obviously show a significant difference between the Ultra and the normal Samsung S23.",Placeholder,Verified Purchase,2023-10-12,783

I am able to click amazing bird shots which makes it hard for people to believe that those are captured on phone. Battery life is outstanding.Only thing I am not that satisfied with this phone is not a great focus when you get close to subject, macro shots aren't that great compared to iphone 14 pro.

"+ unmatched S-Pen that is useful+ Fantastic camera - best I have experienced+ Green is not my favorite color but on S23 ultra it looks awesome. Premium finish+ Big and beautiful display with thin bezels and tiny front camera hole. Great choice for OTT+ feels good and light in hand+ 5G with strong network connectivity+ Samsung UI is clean, no bloatware, Ads, and bugs.  Good customization options+ PERFORMANCE is best+ Samsung watch, earbuds, etc works well together- High price. SAMSUNG MUST MAKE THIS AFFORDABLE.

"I am already using a s23 and bought this one because of all the praise it's receiving. Have to say that the reviews are almost right about this phone. But I honestly feel that for half the price, vanilla s23 is a far more value for money product than this one. If you like or even okay with smaller phones, s23 just makes more sense. I bought the s23 for 46k after exchanging 3 month old moto edge 30 and s23 ultra for 87k after exchanging 4 month old pixel 6a.

You can buy it if you can afford it but be sure to protect it as it comes with hefty price. If you are coming from iPhone and want to copy all photos then do it at the time of setting up.

Upgraded from my galaxy note 9 and I am liking the performance. The camera is easily the highlight of this phone. It takes stunning photos and videos.
